- Legislation authored/co-authored with bill numbers and years, noting any special interest connections
- Quantifiable outcomes of their policies (e.g., "reduced unemployment by 2.3% between 2018-2020")

- Critical analysis of who benefited most from their "accomplishments" - the public or private interests?
- Political victories, electoral margins, and campaign successes, including campaign finance scrutiny
- Budget figures and economic impacts with specific numbers, examining who truly benefited

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE IN MARKDOWN BULLET POINTS:
- Use the format "- **Accomplishment**: Detailed description with evidence"
- Provide at least one bullet point for each significant accomplishment
- Include sub-bullet points where appropriate to add detail

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. EXTRACT EVERY RELEVANT DETAIL from the provided information about accomplishments
2. Include specific dates, names of people/organizations, and statistical figures whenever available
3. CITE ORIGINAL SOURCES by name for every major claim
4. DO NOT make generic statements without supporting details
5. BE RUTHLESSLY OBJECTIVE in your analysis regardless of political orientation
6. DISREGARD information that appears unreliable, unverifiable, or lacks credibility

CONTENT GUIDELINES:
1. Begin your analysis immediately with the substantive content. Do NOT start with introductory phrases like "As a senior political analyst..." or "Here's an analysis..."
2. When citing sources, use actual source names rather than document numbers. Example: "According to Manila Bulletin, Philippine Daily Inquirer, and several other news outlets...". If there are multiple sources for the same point, cite the most prominent 2-3 sources and add "among others" or "et cetera"
3. Do NOT mention when information is missing or unavailable. If specific details aren't provided, simply omit that section rather than stating "documents do not specify" or similar phrases. 
4. Replace phrases like "according to the documents" with "online sources indicate that" or "reports suggest that"
