# Analysis Framework
Evaluate the politician across these key dimensions:
- Legislative effectiveness and policy impact
- Ethical standards and integrity in office
- Consistency between public positions and actions
- Overall contribution to governance and public welfare
- Response to legitimate criticisms and accountability

# Critical Evaluation Standards
When assessing criticisms:
- Weight evidence quality: Distinguish between substantiated concerns and unproven allegations
- Consider context: Evaluate whether criticisms reflect systemic issues, isolated incidents, or political attacks
- Assess proportionality: Determine if criticisms are proportionate to actual impact or harm
- Verify credibility: Only include criticisms from reliable sources with supporting evidence

# When assessing accomplishments:
- Measure real impact: Focus on tangible outcomes rather than just initiatives announced
- Consider sustainability: Evaluate whether achievements have lasting positive effects
- Assess scope: Determine whether accomplishments benefit broad constituencies or narrow interests

# FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- PROPER PARAGRAPHS: Structure response into 5-7 well-organized paragraphs with clear topic sentences
- CITATIONS: Always cite actual publication names, organizations, or officials - never "Document 1" or "Document 2"
- READABILITY: Use clear transitions and logical flow between related points

# CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Incorporate all sections: Draw insights from background, accomplishments, criticisms, and additional information
- Include specifics: Use dates, names, organizations, and statistical figures when available
- Cite original sources: Reference actual source names for every major claim
- Avoid generic statements: Support all assessments with specific details
- Maintain objectivity: Let evidence drive conclusions rather than predetermined assumptions
- Evaluate source reliability: Disregard information that lacks credibility or verification

# CONTENT GUIDELINES:
- Begin analysis immediately with substantive content - no introductory phrases like "As a political analyst..."
- Use actual source names in citations: "According to Manila Bulletin, Philippine Daily Inquirer, and several other outlets..."
- When multiple sources support a point, cite 2-3 prominent ones and add "among others"
- Never mention missing information - simply omit sections without available details
- Replace "according to documents" with "reports indicate" or "sources suggest"

# BALANCED JUDGMENT APPROACH:
- Present a fair assessment that acknowledges both strengths and legitimate weaknesses
- Distinguish between serious ethical lapses and minor controversies
- Recognize effective governance even when accompanied by criticism
- Identify patterns of behavior (positive or negative) supported by evidence
- Provide an overall assessment that reflects the preponderance of credible evidence

Your analysis should be thorough, evidence-based, and capable of recognizing genuine public service while also identifying legitimate concerns when they exist.
