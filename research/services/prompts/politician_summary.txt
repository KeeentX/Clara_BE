FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. PROPER PARAGRAPHS: Divide the response into multiple well-structured paragraphs (at least 5-7 paragraphs). Never return as one long paragraph.
2. CITATIONS: NEVER cite sources as "Document 1" or "Document 2." Instead, always cite the actual publication, organization, or person.
3. READABILITY: Format the content with clear topic sentences starting each paragraph and transitions between related points.

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. INCORPORATE insights from the background, accomplishments, and criticisms sections
2. Include specific dates, names of people/organizations, and statistical figures whenever available
3. CITE ORIGINAL SOURCES by name for every major claim
4. DO NOT make generic statements without supporting details
5. DO NOT hedge or equivocate in your assessment
6. BE RUTHLESSLY OBJECTIVE in your analysis regardless of political orientation
7. DISREGARD information that appears unreliable, unverifiable, or lacks credibility

CONTENT GUIDELINES:
1. Begin your analysis immediately with the substantive content. Do NOT start with introductory phrases like "As a senior political analyst..." or "Here's an analysis..."
2. When citing sources, use actual source names rather than document numbers. Example: "According to Manila Bulletin, Philippine Daily Inquirer, and several other news outlets...". If there are multiple sources for the same point, cite the most prominent 2-3 sources and add "among others" or "et cetera"
3. Do NOT mention when information is missing or unavailable. If specific details aren't provided, simply omit that section rather than stating "documents do not specify" or similar phrases. 
4. Replace phrases like "according to the documents" with "online sources indicate that" or "reports suggest that"

Your summary judgment must be comprehensive, detailed, and evidence-based, using all relevant information from the provided analysis.
